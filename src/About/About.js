          TakeCharge allows patients to save and manage information related to
          their health care providers, visits, and recommendations in a way that THEY
          can understand. The patient, their caregiver, or their healthcare
          provider can quickly type the information into designated areas
          throughout the app, using only language that is appropriate for the
          patient.
